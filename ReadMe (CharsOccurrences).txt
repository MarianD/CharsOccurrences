Beside the plain text in one of the tabs shows the occurrences
of letters and digits in the other tabs:

- in the tab with sortable list of letters, their occurrences
  and percentages

  and percentages

  ordered alphabetically and the right by occurrences

In the tabs with sortable lists is possible to change
order of the columns by dragging their headers.

of occurrences and the sum of all occurrences.

The last chosen tab and the order of the items of the
individual sortable lists are saved and automatically restored

Lister, and even after exit and restart of the Total Commander.

of the English ASCII letters (case insensitively), and
occurrences of the digits.

No manual settings are meanwhile provided.
